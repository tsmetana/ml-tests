# Log Analysis Web Application

A Flask-based web application that uses a trained LSTM model to analyze log files and predict next log entries. The application compares model predictions with actual log lines to provide insights into model performance.

This is an experiment. Not very usable so far.

# Image compression with simple autoencoder

This one is totally useless but helps to understand what embedding does with
data.
